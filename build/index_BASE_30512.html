          <h3>About Khinalig</h3>
          <p>Khinalig is one of the oldest and highest continuously inhabited settlements in the Greater Caucasus and
            Europe, known for its historical and cultural importance. Its unique language, which forms its branch within
            the Nakh-Dagestani
            language family, is spoken only by the people from Khinalig and is distinct from Azerbaijani and the
            languages of neighbouring villages. </p>

          <p>The village's isolated geography has helped preserve its traditions, including indigenous practices, oral
            storytelling, and ancestral customs. This isolation has also kept Khinalig mostly unaffected by imperialism
            and globalisation until
            recently. </p>
          <p>There are three museums: one governmental and two initiated by the villagers. The villagers curate the
            museums by themselves, and there has been little to no government interference. In 2023, Khinalig gained
            UNESCO cultural heritage
            status.</p>

          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>Homecoming is an artistic-ethnographic project about the heritage and my relationship to the village
            of Khinalig. Located in north Azerbaijan, Khinalig is home to an Indigenous minority that speaks a unique
            language. I, an artist of Khinalig origin, explore the nuances of digitalisation and institutionalisation
            and ask how a trained designer can help the community overcome these issues.</p>

          <p>In Homecoming, I explore my relationship with the village of Khinalig, my ancestral home, through an artistic-ethnographic project that seeks to preserve its heritage and culture. Khinalig, a unique and isolated village in northern Azerbaijan, has a rich history and an indigenous language. My project combines digital archiving, collaborative publications, and artistic installations to capture and share the cultural narratives of Khinalig.</p>


          <p>I ask how we might preserve living culture without reifying its forms and how to empower local voices in curatorial decisions traditionally made by external authorities. This project also attempts to reconnect with my heritage through artistic practice, reflecting on identity, belonging, and the complexities of cultural preservation in a globalised world. Through the method I call Homecoming, I aim to offer an alternative approach to heritage that respects local agency and keeps culture alive within its context. </p>

          <h3>Monograph on Khinalig</h3>

          <p>I have pre­pared a mono­graph pre­sent­ing some as­pects of the life and his­tory of Khi­nalig. The for­mat
            and lay­out of this mono­graph are ap­pro­pri­a­tions of the Cen­sus of In­dia vil­lage sur­vey books, a
            for­mat used by post-colo­nial gov­ern­ment ad­min­is­tra­tion work­ers. How­ever, I have in­ter­preted the
            rigid for­mat as a ba­sis for cre­at­ing an overview book of Khi­nalig, an in­tro­duc­tion for those who
            wish to learn more about the vil­lage. Each sec­tion briefly de­scribes as­pects of Khi­nalig: his­tory,
            ge­og­ra­phy, so­cial life, be­liefs and her­itage. The pub­li­ca­tion re­lies heav­ily on oral his­tory and
            uses a looser ap­proach to ref­er­ences, de­lib­er­ately mov­ing away from the strictly aca­d­e­mic
            ap­proach to sourc­ing knowl­edge.</p>

          <h3>Book on Khinalig Language</h3>

          <p>The Book on Khinalig Language is a book that reads like a collage, covering the origin of the indigenous
            language, its relations with other languages in the region, and its transformations from an oral to a
            written form through digitisation and design. My main motivation in talking about language was to cover the
            design and accessibility problems that inevitably arise when language does not have a consistent script. I
            first conducted textual research, ranging from internet searches to reading articles, and then extracted
            quotes from research papers and articles to support my narrative. I interviewed some experts in the field of
            type design and discussed the nuances of digitising unique scripts and creating typefaces for endangered
            languages.</p>

          <h3>Publication based on researcher’s diary</h3>

          <p>During one of my travels to Khinalig, I found the diary of a villager who was composing the archaeological
            excursion hiking route. After his sudden death, relatives stored the diary in his family house but never
            read it. I deciphered, digitalized and translated the material in the diary and selected several excerpts.
            This work is a commentary on the information that gets lost in transliteration: the younger generations of
            Khinalig people cannot read the script their ancestors used to write their notes. The style of this book
            reflects the decay and fragility of ancestral knowledge.</p>

          <p>The installation was specifically created for the Master Thesis exhibition that took place from the 3rd
            until the 5th of April 2025. It has various parts linked to the project and includes many interactive
            pieces. Each of them is made of a different material but is united by one principle: the piece is not
            evident by itself and requires different ways of activation. Some pieces are publications, showcased in a
            special way, some contain photo or video material. Read more about the Homecoming installation and exhibition on the <a id="linkdm"

            <p>Museum: an assembly of significant things, a tapestry of cultures, collaged by a hesitant curator who
              puts a golden horn next to an embroidered crown in front of a marble tomb. Visual contexts evaporate
              leaving only a dry exegesis,
              providing a reasonable meaning to lonely, kidnapped things.</p>
            <p>Mwazulu Diyabanza, among other pan-African activists, is taking the artefacts that belong to his
              ancestors and culture from the museum and bringing them back to homeland. In the interview he says:</p>
            <p class="quote">“When the Europeans arrived, the first bases they broke were cultural bases, now with this
              action we try to restore them.” </p>
            <p>This act of decolonisation left a big impression on me and made me think about ways the museums are or

          <p>Khinalig, the village on the mountain was too isolated and remote for archaeologists and museologists so
            the first excavations started only around 2010. Nowadays there are three museums: one governmental and two
            initiated by the local
            residents. The villagers are curating these museums by themselves, so far there is little to no interference
            from the side of the government. It is not a white cube, you can touch and use some objects, there are
            unwritten stories that are
            told about the things exhibited, the museum, future of the village, archaeological excavations.</p>
          <p>Home museum is especially precious: it is located in the living room of a hunter who has collected things
            in the mountains by himself throughout decades. You come in the living room, eat, drink tea, listen to him
            and look at the objects,
            take them in your hands and rotate them, feel their history not in an alienated manner but here, right in
            front of you, close to the place they were found at.</p>

            <p>Now that the village is slowly gaining the attention of tourists and researchers, how can one preserve the
            local initiatives and curatorial decisions, and most importantly, keep the objects where they were found?
            Maybe it is possible to build an alternative environment for those who want to research, publish, and
            exhibit?</p>
