This stone fell into the village 100 years ago. The house there collapsed, and a person died as a result. Then, 30-40 years later, when digging the foundation, this stone was un- earthed. This stone was not native to our region; no such stone had ever been found in our villageâ€™s territory. Visitors who see it say that it might
be a meteorite, but we do not know for sure what it is.
