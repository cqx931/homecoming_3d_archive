I was digging near the old well, clearing out weeds and loosening the soil when my spade struck something solid. At first, I thought it was just another stone, but when I brushed away the dirt, a small, intricately carved amulet emerged from the earth. Its surface was covered in geometric patterns, worn smooth in places but still distinct, as if whispering an ancient story.

I took it to the village elders, who examined it in silence before exchanging knowing glances. One of them, old Mara, traced the patterns with her fingers and murmured that it must have belonged to the people of the Zangar settlement, whose ancestors once walked these lands. They believed such amulets carried protection, or perhaps guidance, though the true meaning had long been lost to time.

That evening, under the glow of lantern light, we carefully cleaned the amulet and strung it onto a cord. Some said it was fate that I had found it, as if it had been waiting for someone to return it to the world. I still wear it around my neck, not just as an ornament, but as a piece of historyâ€”something that once belonged to the past but now belongs to me.
